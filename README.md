# gerardroche/sublime-sensible

An alternative set of default settings that (hopefully) most of everyone who feel the native default settings don't meet their needs can agree on.

* If you're new to Sublime, and want more than the default settings, you can install this as a starting point.
* If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose settings to use, this can be your neutral territory.
* If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from your settings, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic amenities.
* User settings still take precedence over all of these settings.
